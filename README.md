# Introduction

The EduLadder community has a clear vision of making academics much easier by providing  a peer-to-peer question and answer forum in which user contribution is  licensed under Creative Commons 3.0.  Anyone can edit, remix and reuse the content on our platform freely with attribution required.The contributors of this platform have not been compensated to date, however with the rise of 3rd generation blockchain networks that promise lower transaction fees, scalable throughput, and earth-friendly consensus algorithms,  we’re proud to launch an honorarium program whereby contributors may earn token rewards.  The amount of tokens that each contributor earns is calculated by several factors including their reputation, activity type (post/answer questions), community engagement with their activities,  etc. 

# Tokenomics

EduLadder (ELADR) is a Cardano blockchain utility token project designed to incentivize users of the EduLadder platform (EduLadder.com). User posts, comments, votes, and other forms of engagement will be given weighted values and so users can earn ELADR tokens as rewards for “Proof of Participation” in the community.  

On the beta testing site, internal Cardano wallets will facilitate reward payments from the project’s token supply reserve to active users.  Furthermore, the internal wallets will facilitate user-to-user transactions for tipping and on-platform “gigs deals” such as code audits, copy editing, bug-bounties, etc. 

In the first phase of development, users will be obliged to negotiate and settle gig deals independently using their balance of ELADR tokens. In future development phases (contingent upon adequate project funding for multi-jurisdictional compliance) “gig deal” smart contract escrow functionality may be implemented in some form.
